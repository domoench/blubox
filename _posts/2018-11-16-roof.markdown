# Choosing metal

Compared with asphalt shingles, metal has a lot of advantages as a roofing material:

- __Durability__: Metal roofs are much more durable than asphalt shingles, and should last over
50 years.
- __Energy Efficiency__: Metal roofs, and their [PVDF resin finish][pvdf],
absorb a lot less heat from the sun than shingles, so they're more efficient during
the summer months. You want a roof with high reflectivity (how
much of the sun's energy gets bounced away instead of absorbed) and high emissivity (how quickly
thermal energy gets re-radiated back into the sky after it's been absorbed). Both of these characteristics are combined
into one number called the [Solar Reflective Index][sri]. The range is 0-100, where 100 is better.
An asphalt roof has an SRI around 25, while the steel system I installed [is rated 45][ab-martin-sri].
- __Weight__: Metal roofing is lighter than asphalt shingle. Since the house needs to weigh in at under
10K pounds to stay within the trailer's load rating, any weight saving is a plus.
- __Green__: Steel panels are 100% recyclable (so they claim), and are good for solar panel installations.

It boils down to upfront installation cost vs. lifetime maintenance costs. Metal costs more up
front but pays for itself over time by lasting and saving energy.

I bought 24 gauge steel [A.B. Martin ABSeam Panels][abseam] because they were locally available,
had the best SRI ratings among products I looked into, and especially because all their product
info was available online.
The panels and installation kit cost $1060.

# Design considerations for longevity

It feels like every detail of planning a roof installation is a slight variation
on the same theme: keep water out. Life will be bad if water gets in, and stays in, between the roofing material and
the top of the structure (my SIP panels' OSB). Mold, rot, and ice damage.
It's the same principle that made the [siding rainscreen gap][rainscreen] necessary, but it's even more
important here because the roof is more exposed and is low-slope so water doesn't drain as easily.

## Preventing moisture damage

### Air gap

I replicated the siding rainscreen gap under my steel roofing panels. Just as in the rainscreen, the gap
allows any water that infiltrates the system to drain out while allowing air to move through via the stack
effect and dry things out quickly.

Some additional benefits of the gap in this situation:
- __Prevent ice dams__: Ice dams occur in cold weather when heat from inside the house warms the
bottom layer of snow sitting atop the roof. This layer melts, runs down to a colder area of the roof (usually
an eave overhang), and refreezes. This process repeats and destructive ice buildups form. They're a big problem when
you have shingles, extended eave overhangs, or gutters. My design has none of those but I felt it's probably safest
to guard against the problem.
- __Safety valve for water vapor__: If my SIP assembly wasn't perfect (quite possible), some amount of warm, relatively-humid
air from inside will escape out between through the roof panels. If it's cold outside, moisture from this air could
condense under the roofing panels. The air gap provides ventilation to keep things dry.
- __Less heat absorption during summer__: The air gap prevents direct transfer of heat from the sun into the house
via conduction. This means less stress on the SIP OSB, and lower cooling bills in the summer.

#### Peak and eave details

Here are diagrams of how the roof panels and trim all interface to allow air into the gap while keeping
water out.

### Roof pitch

__*Full disclosure*__: I installed the roof panels at a slightly lower slope than is recommended by the steel panel
manufacturer.

There's a balance to strike between maximizing interior space of the structure and maximizing drainage off the roof.
A completely flat roof would create the most space inside (very important to create a usable loft space within the
max road-legal height constraint of 13.5') but would
provide no gravity drainage. Also the longer your roof, and the more valleys it has, the longer it will take
to shed water, so a steeper slope is necessary to prevent water from rising to the top of the
panel seams and get inside.

The recommended slope for most standing seam systems (including mine from AB Martin) is 3/12 (3" down for every 12" over).
I designed my roof at a slope of 2/12 to get an extra 7" of interior head space on the low side in the loft. I decided
this would not slow drainage enough risk water rising above my panel seems because:
1. The length of my downhill slope is extremely short compared to a normal roof: 8' 7".
1. The roof's profile has no valleys where water running down two different slopes collides.
1. There are no gutters which could get clogged or otherwise impede drainage speed.
1. There is an air gap as an extra safety mechanism to ensure any water that makes it inside can dry out.

# Installation

Installation took me about 4 days. See [my installation vid][install-vid], or check out
[the manual][abseam-instructions] for the gory details.
