I clad the exterior of the tiny house with red cedar, stained blue, and installed over a rainscreen gap to maximize its lifespan.

# Choosing Cedar

I knew that I like the aesthetic look of wood tongue and groove. Red cedar is a durable choice of wood species, as it has a high natural resistance to moisture, warping, rot, and insects. You can pay more to buy "clear" cedar with no knots, but I opted for knotty cedar as I prefer the look and it saves money. Win win.

# Choosing A Finish

There are many options for finishing Red Cedar (described in detail [here][cedar-finishes]), but they seem to boil down to a tradeoff between showcasing the natural beauty of cedar and providing longer-term protection against the elements. At one extreme, some leave red cedar completely unfinished to enjoy the totally natural look and rely completely on the natural weather resistance of the wood. Cedar may be more resistant to the elements that many other wood species, but it will eventually degrade over time, and any sort of finish will extend that time. The most protective finish is paint, which completely hides the natural wood color and some of its texture.

I ended up choosing a [solid stain][behr-solid] - which offers a lot of protection from the elements but doesn't obscure the texture of the wood. The cedar boards come with a rough side and a smooth side. I installed the cedar with it's rough side out, which provides a much stronger adhesion for the stain for a more durable finish.

I've read conflicting accounts of whether primer is necessary before painting the rough side of cedar with a solid stain. It seems that one of the main reasons why one would absolutely need to prime woods like cedar, which have tannins that bleed, is if they want to stain the wood a light color. Since cedar is already a durable wood, and I'm finishing with a dark solid stain, and because the Behr stain instructions indicate state that primer, I skipped the primer apply the stain directly. 1 year in the stain still looks great.

I stained both sides of my cedar boards before cutting, then stained the cut edges as I cut and installed them.

# What is a rainscreen gap?

A rainscreen gap is an air gap between the sheathing of a building and the exterior siding. It vastly improves the drying speed of the siding in a couple ways:
1. The gap pulls air through via the [stack effect][stack-effect] which speeds drying
1. The gap allows water to drain and prevents wicking water up between the sheathing and siding.

There's [a super in-depth article][gba-rainscreen] on rainscreens on the Green Building Advisors website.

Here's a side-view diagram of rainscreen gap. The top is open to air, but protected by the small eave to ensure water doesn't flow into the gap.

Guarding against moisture damage is a good idea in any situation, but it's especially important for this tiny house. I designed the structure with no eaves to maximize the inside space within the width constraint of a road-legal trailer (8.5' in most states) and to minimize wind updraft forces on the roof during transport. The downside to no eaves is no protection of the siding from rain. So since my siding will get wet relatively often, it needs to be able to dry out quickly.

I used 3/8" thick plastic [CedarVent][cedarvent] furring strips from to create my rainscreen gap. They are corrugated so they still allow water and air to pass through when installed horizontally. I got some with an attached mesh to serve as the top and bottom strips to keep insects out of the gap.

# Cedar Siding Installation

I attached the tongue and groove cedar by blind nailing with 2" 16-gauge stainless steel fasteners. I used a 16" O.C. fastening schedule (through each furring strip), plus 3 more spaced in between. I added those extra nails because aren't regular studs in a SIP wall for the fasteners to bite into, only the outer 1/2" OSB skin.

Installation was generally straightforward and repetitive gruntwork. The only trick I had to develop was planning ahead to ensure the board joints ended up in the right place relative to the edges of windows and walls. If you don't do this you can end up with board edges that are not plumb to a window, or are too thin and splinter while working with them or nailing them. There is about 1/16" of fudge-ability when seating the tongue into the groove at a joint, so by planning a number of boards ahead it's possible to control when the joint lands.

I didn't keep precise track, but the whole process boiled down to about 10 full days of labor staining, cutting, and installing (and re-cutting + installing pieces I messed up). I spent $2000 on cedar and $370 on the CedarVent strips to create the rainscreen gap.

## Interface with windows

I installed my siding around my windows and doors without any trim because I like that simple look. The siding easily clears the nail fin of all my windows because of my rainscreen gap. I left a 1/8" gap between the edge of my siding boards and the windows. I caulked in that gap to prevent rain water from flowing from the outside of my siding into the rainscreen at the windows.
