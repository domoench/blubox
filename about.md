All about a 30-year-old man living with his parents.

Just kidding, it's a blog about building a tiny house. See 
[THE FIRST POST]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-06-06-intro %})
for more detail.

I am living with my parents though, but this isn't about that.

Feel free to email any questions or suggestions (e.g. "you aren't doing it right"). I'll address them in future posts: {% include email-link.html %}
